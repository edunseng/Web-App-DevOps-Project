Framework Directory Overview
----------------------------

The 'framework' directory serves as the backbone of our infrastructure and deployment strategy within the wider codebase. It encapsulates a suite of scripts, libraries, and configurations that provide a structured approach to managing cloud resources, automating deployments, and streamlining DevOps practices.

Purpose:
--------

The creation of this framework is driven by the need for consistency, repeatability, and efficiency in deploying and managing applications across various environments. By centralizing common operations and best practices into this directory, we enable developers and operations teams to focus on delivering value rather than reinventing the wheel for each project or environment setup.

Contents:
---------

1. cluster-management
   - Contains scripts related to the configuration, management, and deletion of Kubernetes clusters. This includes setting up environment-specific variables, fetching outputs from Terraform, and cleaning up resources.

2. libraries
   - A collection of shared scripts that provide utility functions for Azure interactions, error handling, file manipulation, and Terraform commands. These libraries are meant to be sourced by other scripts to extend their capabilities.

3. project-setup
   - Houses the setup scripts for specific projects, such as 'my-flask-webapp'. It includes scripts for creating deployment files, AKS modules, Kubernetes manifests, network modules, and root Terraform configurations.

4. utilities
   - Offers a set of utility scripts that support various operations like ensuring tool installations, setting up Azure credentials, managing Kubernetes deployments, and orchestrating Terraform workflows.

Reasoning Behind the Framework:
-------------------------------

The framework is designed with modularity and reusability in mind, allowing for:

- **Rapid Onboarding**: New team members can quickly understand the project's infrastructure and deployment processes by reviewing the framework's standardized scripts and documentation.

- **Scalability**: As the codebase grows, the framework can be easily extended to accommodate new services, tools, or practices without disrupting existing workflows.

- **Maintainability**: Centralized scripts mean that updates or fixes can be made in one place and benefit all projects that use the framework.

- **Best Practices**: Encapsulating proven patterns and practices in the framework ensures that all projects adhere to the same high standards of reliability, security, and performance.

- **Automation**: By automating repetitive tasks, the framework reduces the potential for human error and frees up time for teams to focus on more complex problems.

Overall, the 'framework' directory is a critical component of our DevOps ecosystem, providing the necessary tools and processes to manage infrastructure and deployments effectively.

Note:
-----
This framework assumes familiarity with the technologies involved, such as Azure, Kubernetes, and Terraform. Users should have appropriate permissions and access to the required services to utilize the scripts fully. Always test scripts in a controlled environment before applying them to production systems.
