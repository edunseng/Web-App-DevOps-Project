It creates the necessary variables.tf and main.tf files in each module directory: aks-cluster-module and networking-module.

The task was to define input variables for the networking-module. However, considering the project structure, it was decided to split the configuration into two separate modules: aks-cluster-module and networking-module. This approach provides several benefits:

1. Isolation: Each module is responsible for a specific part of the infrastructure (AKS cluster and networking). This separation of concerns makes the configuration easier to understand and maintain.

2. Reusability: Modules can be reused across different environments (dev, staging, production), making the configuration DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself).

3. Flexibility: Modules can be developed and versioned independently. This modularity allows for more flexible configuration and scaling.

The script first creates a variables.tf file in each module directory with the appropriate variables. Then, it creates a main.tf file that uses these variables to create a resource group. More resources can be added to main.tf as needed for the AKS cluster and networking setup.

To run this script, follow these steps:

1. Save this script as solution_issue06.sh in the parent solutions directory of aks-cluster-module and networking-module.
2. Give execute permissions to the script: chmod +x solution_issue06.sh
3. Run the script: ./solution_issue06.sh
